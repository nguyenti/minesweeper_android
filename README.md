Minesweeper Android
===================

Android application to learn about using a canvas as well as creating your own view. Created for Mobile development course.

Criteria: 5x5 grid, 3 mines, flag all mines to win. If you flag a non-mine, you automatically lose.

Implemented: display of mines, numbers, and flags; detect loss;

Extra work: group click 0's as in the original minesweeper; detect win instead of flagging all mines;

ToDo: let the user decide the size of grid and number of mines.
